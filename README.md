#yeoman generator-ng-panes

Based on the original [generator-angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) with some extra methods, 
and getting it ready to work with io.js.

##NEW FEATURES

1. Allow you to choose from different UI framework (Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic-UI and more)
2. This generator will be ready for AngularJS 2.0 when its ready. The generator will ask you if you want v.1 or v.2
3. This generator will use Gulp by default. 
4. The dist compilation will be little different (all templates will get generate into js files)
5. The Angular module configuration will be a little bit different. It will use angular DOM attachment instead of writing it into the HTML. This will give you the opportunity to use dynamic loading scheme. 

And more. 

This is part of the panes.js series of tools.
