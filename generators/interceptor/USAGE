Description/简介:

    DO NOT USE - NOT WORKING AT THE MOMENT

    Creates an interceptor and inject into your main module.

    Pleaes note this sub-generator is the only that doesn't support module.

    An interceptor is global by nature, hence there is no point to put it any other places.

    Of course, you can manually change that later. But becare interceptor will overwrite each other.

Example/示范:

    yo ng-panes:interceptor _NAME_OF_INTERCEPTOR_
