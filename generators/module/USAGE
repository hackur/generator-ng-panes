Description/简介:

	Create a module structure.

Example/示范:

	yo ng-panes:module _MODULE_NAME_

	This will create the following structure

	app/modules/_MODULE_NAME_/module.js

	The module file will be standalone
	depends on what router you have selected. It will create a config here
	with the routing provider pass to it. But it won't have any entry.

	angular.module('_MODULE_NAME_' , [])

How to add other assets:

	All the other sub generator will require to pass the --module _MODULE_NAME_ flag
	so they will put the files in the right places.
